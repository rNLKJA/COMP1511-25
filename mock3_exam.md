    struct node *temp = ______;
    head = ______;

```c
struct node* delete_value(struct node *head, int value) {

        return head;  // What's wrong here?
    }
    
    struct node *current = head;
    while (current->next != NULL && current->next->data != value) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    if (current->next != NULL) {
        current->next = current->next->next;
    }
    
    return head;
}
```

**Question 18:** Complete this function to count positive numbers in a linked list:
```c
int count_positive(struct node *head) {
    int count = 0;
    struct node *current = ______;
    
    while (______ != NULL) {
        if (current->data > ______) {
            ______;
        }
        current = ______;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

**Question 19:** Arrange these lines to create a function that deletes the tail node:

B. struct node* delete_tail(struct node *head) {
C. if (head->next == NULL) {
D. free(head);
E. return NULL;
F. }
G. struct node *current = head;
H. while (current->next->next != NULL) {
I. current = current->next;
J. }
K. free(current->next);
L. current->next = NULL;
M. return head;
N. }
```

Write the correct order: _________________________

**Question 20:** What will this code print for the list 1->2->3->NULL?
```c
struct node *current = head;
int count = 0;
while (current != NULL) {

    current = current->next;
}
printf("Count: %d", count);
```

## Section C: Problem Solving (25 marks)

**Question 21: Exam Strategy (10 marks)**
You're taking a 2-hour exam with these questions:
- 20 Multiple choice (2 marks each) - estimated 20 minutes
- 5 Short functions (6 marks each) - estimated 60 minutes  
- 2 Full programs (20 marks each) - estimated 40 minutes

a) What's your time allocation strategy? (3 marks)
b) Which questions would you attempt first and why? (4 marks)
c) How would you handle a question you're stuck on? (3 marks)

**Question 22: Debug Analysis (15 marks)**
A student wrote this linked list function but it has multiple bugs:

```c
struct node* insert_sorted(struct node *head, int value) {
    struct node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    new_node->data = value;
    
    if (head == NULL || value < head->data) {
        new_node->next = head;
        return new_node;
    }
    
    struct node *current = head;
    while (current->next != NULL && current->next->data < value) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    new_node->next = current->next;
    current->next = new_node;
    
    return head;
}
```

a) Identify two potential issues with this code (6 marks)
b) Write the corrected version (9 marks)

---

## Section D: Implementation (20 marks)

**Question 23: Complete Linked List Implementation (20 marks)**
Write a complete program that demonstrates linked list operations:

**Requirements:**
1. **Define a node structure** for storing integers
2. **Implement these functions:**
   - `struct node* create_node(int data)` - creates a new node
   - `struct node* insert_head(struct node *head, int data)` - inserts at beginning
   - `struct node* delete_value(struct node *head, int value)` - deletes first occurrence
   - `void print_list(struct node *head)` - prints all values
   - `void free_list(struct node *head)` - frees all memory

3. **In main function:**
   - Create a list with values: 10, 20, 30
   - Print the list
   - Delete the value 20
   - Print the list again
   - Free all memory

**Example Output:**
```
List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
After deleting 20: 10 -> 30 -> NULL
```

**Grading Criteria:**
- Correct struct definition (2 marks)
- Proper create_node implementation (3 marks)
- Correct insert_head implementation (4 marks)
- Proper delete_value with memory management (6 marks)
- Working print_list and main function (3 marks)
- Memory cleanup (2 marks)
