# Lecture 13-15: Linked List Deletion and Exam Preparation - Mastering Data Manipulation and Assessment Success

## Why These Topics Matter

These lectures represent the culmination of your data structure journey and preparation for demonstrating your programming mastery. Linked list deletion completes your toolkit for dynamic data manipulation - imagine being able to not just create and read data, but also safely remove it while maintaining system integrity. The exam preparation helps you showcase all these skills confidently in an assessment environment.

**Discussion:** How is safely removing items from a linked list similar to removing people from a conga line without breaking the chain? What challenges might arise?

## 1. Linked List Deletion Operations: The Art of Safe Removal

### Understanding Deletion Challenges

Think of linked list deletion like safely removing train cars from a moving train. You need to disconnect the car you want to remove while ensuring the remaining cars stay properly linked together. Each type of deletion (head, tail, middle) presents unique challenges, just like removing the engine, caboose, or middle cars each requires different techniques.

**Discussion:** What could go wrong if you don't properly reconnect the train cars after removing one? How does this relate to pointer management?

### Complete Deletion Toolkit

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
    int data;           // The cargo in this train car
    struct node *next;  // The coupling to the next car
};

// Function prototypes - our deletion toolkit
struct node* create_node(int data);
struct node* insert_head(struct node *head, int data);
struct node* delete_head(struct node *head);
struct node* delete_tail(struct node *head);
struct node* delete_value(struct node *head, int value);
struct node* delete_at_position(struct node *head, int position);
void print_list(struct node *head);
void free_list(struct node *head);
int list_length(struct node *head);

// Create a new train car
struct node* create_node(int data) {
    struct node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));  // Build a new car
    if (new_node == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");  // Factory couldn't build the car
        return NULL;
    }
    new_node->data = data;    // Load the cargo
    new_node->next = NULL;    // No coupling yet
    return new_node;          // Car ready for service
}

// Add a car to the front (for testing our deletion)
struct node* insert_head(struct node *head, int data) {
    struct node *new_node = create_node(data);  // Build new front car
    if (new_node == NULL) return head;          // Keep old train if building failed
    
    new_node->next = head;  // Couple new car to current front
    return new_node;        // New car becomes the engine
}

// Remove the front car (engine) - like changing locomotives
struct node* delete_head(struct node *head) {
    // Safety check: is there even a train to work with?
    if (head == NULL) {
        printf("Cannot delete from empty list\n");  // No train in the station
        return NULL;
    }
    
    // Remember which car we're removing
    struct node *node_to_delete = head;  // Point to the current engine
    
    // Promote the second car to be the new engine
    head = head->next;  // Second car becomes new front
    
    // Safely dispose of the old engine
    free(node_to_delete);  // Send old engine to scrapyard
    
    printf("Head node deleted successfully\n");
    return head;  // Return the new front of the train
}

// Remove the last car (caboose) - trickiest because we need the second-to-last
struct node* delete_tail(struct node *head) {
    // Safety check: empty train?
    if (head == NULL) {
        printf("Cannot delete from empty list\n");

    if (head->next == NULL) {
        free(head);  // Scrap the only car
        printf("Only node deleted (was tail)\n");
        return NULL;  // Now we have no train
    }
    
    // Find the car just before the caboose
    struct node *current = head;
    while (current->next->next != NULL) {  // Stop when next car is the last
        current = current->next;  // Walk down the train
    }
    
    // Now current points to second-to-last, current->next is the caboose
    free(current->next);    // Scrap the caboose
    current->next = NULL;   // Second-to-last becomes new caboose
    
    printf("Tail node deleted successfully\n");

    return head;

// Remove car at specific position (like "remove the 3rd car")
struct node* delete_at_position(struct node *head, int position) {
    // Safety checks

        return head;
    }
    
    // Remove the car at the target position
    struct node *node_to_delete = current->next;  // The car we want to remove
    current->next = current->next->next;          // Bridge over it

    printf("Node at position %d deleted\n", position);
    return head;

// Display the entire train
void print_list(struct node *head) {

    int length = 0;
    struct node *current = head;
    while (current != NULL) {

                break;
        }
    } while (choice != 0);
    
    free_list(head);  // Scrap the entire train when done
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Deletion Principles:**
1. **Always check for empty list** - like checking if there's a train at the station
2. **Handle special cases** - engine removal is different from middle car removal
3. **Maintain links** - always bridge connections before removing cars
4. **Free memory** - send removed cars to the scrapyard (prevent memory leaks)
5. **Update head pointer** - if removing the engine, promote the next car

**Exercise:** Trace through deleting the value 3 from the list 7->1->3->5. What steps are involved?

## 2. Advanced Deletion Scenarios: Professional-Grade Error Handling

### Building Robust Deletion Functions

Professional software needs to handle every possible scenario gracefully. Think of this like building a safety system for train operations - you need protocols for every situation: empty stations, single-car trains, missing cars, and system failures.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};

typedef enum {
    DELETE_SUCCESS,
    DELETE_EMPTY_LIST,
    DELETE_NOT_FOUND,
    DELETE_INVALID_POSITION,
    DELETE_MEMORY_ERROR
} DeleteResult;

// Safe deletion with comprehensive error handling
DeleteResult safe_delete_value(struct node **head, int value) {
    if (head == NULL || *head == NULL) {
        return DELETE_EMPTY_LIST;
    }
    
    // Special case: deleting head
    if ((*head)->data == value) {
        struct node *temp = *head;
        *head = (*head)->next;
        free(temp);
        return DELETE_SUCCESS;
    }
    
    // Find node before the one to delete
    struct node *current = *head;
    while (current->next != NULL && current->next->data != value) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    if (current->next == NULL) {
        return DELETE_NOT_FOUND;
    }
    
    // Perform deletion
    struct node *temp = current->next;
    current->next = current->next->next;
    free(temp);
    
    return DELETE_SUCCESS;
}

// Delete all occurrences of a value
DeleteResult delete_all_occurrences(struct node **head, int value) {
    if (head == NULL || *head == NULL) {
        return DELETE_EMPTY_LIST;
    }
    
    int deleted_count = 0;
    
    // Handle head nodes with the value
    while (*head != NULL && (*head)->data == value) {
        struct node *temp = *head;
        *head = (*head)->next;
        free(temp);
        deleted_count++;
    }
    
    // Handle remaining nodes
    if (*head != NULL) {
        struct node *current = *head;
        while (current->next != NULL) {
            if (current->next->data == value) {
                struct node *temp = current->next;
                current->next = current->next->next;
                free(temp);
                deleted_count++;
            } else {
                current = current->next;
            }
        }
    }
    
    printf("Deleted %d occurrences of %d\n", deleted_count, value);
    return deleted_count > 0 ? DELETE_SUCCESS : DELETE_NOT_FOUND;
}

// Delete nodes based on condition
DeleteResult delete_if(struct node **head, int (*condition)(int)) {
    if (head == NULL || *head == NULL) {
        return DELETE_EMPTY_LIST;
    }
    
    int deleted_count = 0;
    
    // Handle head nodes that meet condition
    while (*head != NULL && condition((*head)->data)) {
        struct node *temp = *head;

        deleted_count++;
    }
    
    // Handle remaining nodes
    if (*head != NULL) {
        struct node *current = *head;
        while (current->next != NULL) {
            if (condition(current->next->data)) {
                struct node *temp = current->next;
                current->next = current->next->next;
                free(temp);
                deleted_count++;
            } else {
                current = current->next;
            }
        }
    }
    
    printf("Deleted %d nodes based on condition\n", deleted_count);
    return deleted_count > 0 ? DELETE_SUCCESS : DELETE_NOT_FOUND;
}

// Condition functions for delete_if
int is_even(int value) {
    return value % 2 == 0;
}

int is_negative(int value) {
    return value < 0;
}

int is_greater_than_ten(int value) {
    return value > 10;
}

// Print error messages
void print_delete_result(DeleteResult result, const char *operation) {
    switch (result) {
        case DELETE_SUCCESS:
            printf("%s completed successfully\n", operation);
            break;
        case DELETE_EMPTY_LIST:
            printf("Error: Cannot %s from empty list\n", operation);
            break;
        case DELETE_NOT_FOUND:
            printf("Error: Value not found for %s\n", operation);
            break;
        case DELETE_INVALID_POSITION:
            printf("Error: Invalid position for %s\n", operation);
            break;
        case DELETE_MEMORY_ERROR:
            printf("Error: Memory error during %s\n", operation);
            break;
    }
}

// Helper functions
struct node* create_node(int data) {
    struct node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    if (new_node == NULL) return NULL;
    new_node->data = data;
    new_node->next = NULL;
    return new_node;
}

struct node* insert_head(struct node *head, int data) {
    struct node *new_node = create_node(data);
    if (new_node == NULL) return head;
    new_node->next = head;
    return new_node;
}

void print_list(struct node *head) {
    printf("List: ");
    while (head != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", head->data);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}

void free_list(struct node *head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        struct node *temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        free(temp);
    }
}

int main(void) {
    struct node *head = NULL;
    
    // Create test list: 15 -> -3 -> 8 -> -3 -> 12 -> 4 -> -3
    head = insert_head(head, -3);
    head = insert_head(head, 4);
    head = insert_head(head, 12);
    head = insert_head(head, -3);
    head = insert_head(head, 8);
    head = insert_head(head, -3);
    head = insert_head(head, 15);
    
    printf("Initial list:\n");
    print_list(head);
    
    // Test safe deletion
    DeleteResult result = safe_delete_value(&head, 8);
    print_delete_result(result, "delete value 8");
    print_list(head);
    
    // Test delete all occurrences
    result = delete_all_occurrences(&head, -3);
    print_delete_result(result, "delete all -3");
    print_list(head);
    
    // Test conditional deletion
    result = delete_if(&head, is_even);
    print_delete_result(result, "delete even numbers");
    print_list(head);
    
    free_list(head);
    return 0;
}
**Challenge:** How would you implement delete_all_occurrences to remove every instance of a value? What about conditional deletion based on custom criteria?

## 3. Exam-Style Practice Problems: Your Assessment Success Toolkit

### Understanding Hurdle Questions

Hurdle questions are like basic driving test maneuvers - you must demonstrate core competency to proceed. They test fundamental skills that every programmer needs. Think of them as "Can you safely navigate a roundabout?" rather than "Can you parallel park in a tight space?"

**Discussion:** Why do you think exams include hurdle questions? What fundamental skills do they ensure you have mastered?

### Problem 1: Find Largest Value in Linked List - The Talent Scout

This is like being a talent scout looking through a line of athletes to find the tallest one. You need to examine each person while keeping track of the tallest you've seen so far.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
    int data;           // The athlete's height
    struct node *next;  // Pointer to the next athlete in line
};

// Find the tallest athlete in the lineup - basic version
int largest(struct node *head) {
    // Edge case: empty lineup
    if (head == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Empty list\n");
        return -1;  // No athletes to measure
    }
    
    // Start by assuming the first athlete is the tallest
    int max_value = head->data;
    struct node *current = head->next;  // Move to the second athlete
    
    // Walk through the rest of the lineup
    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->data > max_value) {  // Found someone taller?
            max_value = current->data;    // Remember this new record
        }
        current = current->next;  // Move to the next athlete
    }
    
    return max_value;  // Return the height of the tallest athlete
}

// Professional version with better error handling
int largest_safe(struct node *head, int *result) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        return 0;  // Function failed - no result to report
    }
    
    *result = head->data;           // Store first athlete's height in result
    struct node *current = head->next;  // Start checking from second athlete
    
    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->data > *result) {  // Found someone taller?
            *result = current->data;    // Update our result
        }
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    return 1;  // Function succeeded - check the result variable
}
```

**Key Learning:** Always handle the empty list case first, then use a "champion so far" approach to track the maximum value.

**Exercise:** How would you modify this to find the smallest value? What about finding the second largest?

### Problem 2: Count Perfect Squares - The Mathematical Detective

Like a detective looking for specific clues in a crowd, you need to identify numbers that are perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25...).

```c
// Simple approach - like checking if a number has an integer square root
int is_perfect_square(int n) {
    if (n < 0) return 0;  // Negative numbers can't be perfect squares
    
    // Try each possible square root until we find a match or go too far
    for (int i = 0; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (i * i == n) {
            return 1;  // Found it! n is a perfect square
        }
    }
    return 0;  // Not a perfect square
}

// Count perfect squares in the linked list
int count_squares(struct node *head) {
    int count = 0;
    struct node *current = head;
    
    while (current != NULL) {
        if (is_perfect_square(current->data)) {  // Is this a perfect square?
            count++;  // Add it to our count
        }
        current = current->next;  // Move to next number
    }
    
    return count;
}

### Problem 3: Array Processing - The Fitness Tracker

Working with arrays of structs is like analyzing a week of fitness data - you need to process multiple pieces of related information.

```c
struct fitness_data {
    int steps;       // Daily step count
    double distance; // Distance traveled
    int calories;    // Calories burned
};

// Calculate total steps for the week - like adding up daily totals
int total_steps(struct fitness_data data[], int size) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        total += data[i].steps;  // Add each day's steps
    }
    return total;
}

// Find the most active day - like finding your best workout day
int max_calories_day(struct fitness_data data[], int size) {
    if (size <= 0) return -1;  // No data to analyze
    
    int max_day = 0;           // Assume first day was best
    int max_calories = data[0].calories;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {  // Check remaining days
        if (data[i].calories > max_calories) {
            max_calories = data[i].calories;
            max_day = i;  // New record day
        }
    }
    return max_day;
}
```
